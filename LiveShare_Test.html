                <h2>A League</h2>
                <p>A league does not exist in Columbus any longer. It used to, but only had ex-professional players, and didn't last long.</p>

                <h2>B League</h2>
                <p>B League does still exist in Columbus, but there are few teams. Mostly ex-Division A college players and semi-pro players.

                <h2>C League</h2>
                <p>C League is one of the bigger leagues. It is made up of a lot of former varsity high school players, ex-pros who have aged a bit too much for B league, and some newer players who picked up the game very quickly.</p>
                <p>For example, my next C league game is on <time datetime="2022-03-3 22:20"> this coming Wednesday</time>.</p>
